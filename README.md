# Project Name: C# Console Calculator

## Project Description
This project is a fully functional calculator built as a C# console application. It demonstrates arithmetic operations, exception handling, object-oriented programming principles, memory storage, and user interaction entirely through keyboard input. It is designed to meet the Week 5 specifications for the ECPI C# programming course.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Environment Setup**
  - Set up .NET SDK and terminal-based C# environment
  - Configure GitHub repository
- **Task 2: Calculator Logic**
  - Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
  - Handle multiple-number operations
  - Display results with at least two decimal places
- **Task 3: Memory System**
  - Create memory functions to store, recall, and manage up to 10 values
  - Support for both single and multiple floating-point numbers
- **Task 4: Input Validation and Exception Handling**
  - Validate all user inputs
  - Prevent division by zero
  - Handle null or invalid inputs gracefully
- **Task 5: Documentation and Testing**
  - Build input validation, unit test core functions manually
  - Capture screenshots and document expected behavior
- **Task 6: Submission and Version Control**
  - Ensure project follows naming and formatting conventions
  - Store project in GitHub with a README and required documentation

## Project Skills Learned
- Object-oriented programming in C#
- Defensive coding with exception handling
- User input validation and parsing
- Console-based user interaction design
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Language Used
- **C# (.NET Console App)**: Used for its strong typing and structured approach ideal for learning object-oriented design and exception handling.

## Development Process Used
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Each week built on the lastâ€”starting from basic operations, adding memory and error handling, and finalizing with multi-value logic and documentation.
